# Tempest

Forecast is a PHP Script which needs the following preconditions :

1.) a Tempest Weather Station from Weather flow, 
2.) a Token you can generate here : https://tempestwx.com/settings/tokens/ 
3.) the Station ID from the weather station 
4.) IP Symcon which you can find here : https://www.symcon.de/

The Software will install itself and will create three html pages which give you details of the daily, hourly and immediate Weather condition
The Script allows for a large degree of customization. Those parameters can be stored locally and  used on the fly

The devleopment of the Software is discussed in the following Forum : https://community.symcon.de/t/tempest/51636

More details can be found in the header of the script
